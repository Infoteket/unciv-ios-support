## Support & Troubleshooting

This page collects iOS-specific notes, known issues, and guidance.

### About This Port

**Unciv iOS is a port of the Unciv project**, an open-source, moddability-focused remake of Civilization V made with LibGDX. The iOS version brings the same gameplay and features to Apple devices while maintaining compatibility with the main project.

**Release Schedule:** This iOS port follows the Unciv project's release schedule. The main project releases frequently as features and fixes become ready—there is no fixed release cadence. When new versions of Unciv are released on GitHub, corresponding iOS updates will be published to the App Store. For the latest information about upcoming features and fixes, check the [Unciv GitHub releases](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/releases) page and join the [Unciv Discord community](https://discord.gg/bjrB4Xw).
