# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 2, 2025

This privacy policy describes how the Unciv iOS app (the "App") handles data. The App is an iOS client for the open-source game Unciv. The App is maintained by Infoteket. If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue on the project issue tracker: https://github.com/Infoteket/unciv-support/issues

## What personal data does the app collect?

The Unciv iOS app itself does not collect personal data for the app developer (Infoteket). Specifically:

- The app does not collect or transmit analytics, crash reports, advertising identifiers, device contacts, photos, or other personal information to Infoteket.

## Multiplayer and third-party servers

Multiplayer games started from the iOS app are, by default, created on the Unciv project's multiplayer servers (operated by the Unciv project). When you create or join multiplayer games, the game server(s) may process information necessary to run the game such as the player name you supply, game metadata and network information (for example IP addresses). Infoteket does not control those third-party servers and is not responsible for their practices. For details about how the Unciv project operates its servers or handles data, please consult the original Unciv project and documentation: https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/

## Data sharing

The App does not share collected data with third parties for advertising or analytics purposes because the App does not collect such data. Multiplayer game data is exchanged with the Unciv servers so players can play together; that exchange is necessary for the multiplayer functionality.

## Data retention

Any data stored by the Unciv multiplayer servers (game state, player names, logs) is retained by those servers according to the Unciv project's retention policies. Infoteket does not receive or retain personal data from the app beyond what you explicitly enter during gameplay (for example a player name).

## Your choices and contact

If you have questions about privacy or want to request removal of content hosted by the Unciv project servers, please open an issue on the Unciv iOS support tracker: https://github.com/Infoteket/unciv-support/issues

For privacy matters specifically related to the Unciv project servers, please consult the Unciv project documentation or contact the Unciv project maintainers directly.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date above.
